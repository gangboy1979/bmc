Package: libntpconf (1.0.4); urgency = high

Abstract:
	Problem : 
	* When there is no DNS server at the time of booting of the device, the ntdate.sh script dont have any DNS server to resolve the NTP server names. so its taking long time for the device to boot.
	* In VLAN mode, at the time of booting the startup script to configure VLAN interface is called after ntpdate.sh which is a NTP related script and due to above mentioned problem it is taking very long time to configure VLAN interface and its network configurations.

Solution :
	Moving the Run level execution of ntpdate.sh script after the execution of vlannetworking script solves this problem. I.e. keep vlannetworking script after S40networking script and ntpdate.sh script after VLAN run level script as S42ntpdate.sh.
